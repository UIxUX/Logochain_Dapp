# Logochain_Dapp

A Logo Marketplace Dapp created with Ethereum, Ethereum Bridge, Oraclize, Node.js & MongoDB. 
A Designer can upvote a Logo and define a price. Once a logo gets upvoted, it price increases by 1%. If it gets purchased, the designer receives 95% of the price, wheareas the remaining 5% get distributed among the upvoters, thus an incentive is being created.
